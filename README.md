    About this project:
</h2>

<p style="color: darkgrey">
    The <a href="https://alice.yandex.ru/station">smart station from Yandex</a> became the basis of the project. We also decided to rethink the management of the station, replacing the usual <a style="color: #BF2C34">voice commands</a> with <a style="color: #4FB06D">gestures</a>. This has allowed us to increase the range of consumers, as well as simplify the use of our station.
